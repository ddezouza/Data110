## About me
I was born in Brazil and moved to the US when I was 12 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology with a focus on wetlands ecology, but when I started working I ended up going into research project management and I'm now a research analyst for a cybersecurity consulting company. 

I wanted to improve my data analysis and visualization credentials, so I'm currently working on a Data Science Certificate at Montgomery college.
