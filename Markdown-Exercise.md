## Introduction
I was born in Brazil and moved to the US when I was 12 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in Biology with a focus on wetlands ecology, but when I started working I ended up going into research project management and I'm now a research analyst for a cybersecurity consulting company. 

I wanted to improve my data analysis and visualization credentials, so I'm currently working on a Data Science Certificate at Montgomery college.

- Reading
  - Favourite Book: *The Count of Monte Cristo*, by Alexandre Dumas

### Learning in 2025
2025 has started as a pretty heavy year learning-wise for me. I'm currently taking lots of different classes, including of course this one. 
Here are all the classes I'm taking currently: 

1. Data 101
2. Data 110
3. ISC2 Cybersecurity Certified Certification Course
4. Beginner Mandarin for Adults

This may not seem like much for a full-time student, but I also have a full-time job!! 

As I mentioned, I'm currently working as a Research Analyst for a consulting company called [ACA Aponix.](https://www.acaglobal.com/our-solutions/cybersecurity-privacy-risk)[^1]
[^1]:ACA Aponix is a branch of GRC advisory services company ACA Group. Aponix is the business unit focused primarily on cybersecurity. 

#### Coding
The only coding experience I had before this class was working with R for my biostatistics classes in college. Needless to say, I have no experience using Python and this is my first time actually working with markdown as well. Hopefully I'll get the hang of things. 

I was pleasantly surprised to be working with R once again for Prof. Alraee's Data 101 class. Our first homework was using a package called "swirl". It essentially lets you take different pre-programmed courses directly through the R console, which was really interesting. 
Here's the code to install the package and bring it up: 

```R
install.packages("swirl")
library("swirl")
swirl()
```
